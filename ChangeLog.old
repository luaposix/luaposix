2006-10-12  Leo Razoumov <slonik.az _AT_ gmail.com>
  * Starting with Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo (LHF) 2006-04-07 version of
    lposix.c fixed the following problems when compiling for Lua-5.1 (Lua-5.1.x)
    o Added missing functions to lposix.c: Prmdir, Punlink
    o Restored older lposix-5.0 implementation of the following functions:
      Pumask, Pchmod
  * restored modemuncher.c from lposix-5.0 since April 2006 lposix.c version has broken
    implementation of modemunch(...) function.
  * Function Ptimes: wrong conversion of clock ticks to seconds. Replaced
    scaling by CLOCKS_PER_SEC macro (that should never be used, btw) with 
    POSIX compliant sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) value.
  * Update test.lua and tree.lua to reflect lposix.c API changes
  * Deleted posix.lua loader file not needed anymore in Lua-5.1 module system
  * Remaining problems: Pumask does not take mask in octal form, it only
    understand alphabetic notation like "u=rwx"
