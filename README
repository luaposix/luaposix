This is a POSIX library for Lua 5.0.

To try this Lua library, edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua.
Then run make. This will build lposix.so and run a simple test. If everything
is ok, install lposix.so and posix.lua in some official place. You may want
to edit posix.lua to change the default value of SOPATH (you can also set the
environment variable LUA_SOPATH at run time).

Here is a brief explanation of the files in this package:
  lposix.c        posix library
  posix.lua       support code
  test.lua        test code
  tree.lua        tree view of the file system

The only documentation is the reference manual written by Claudio Terra for
the original release of poslib. See
	http://www.soho-one.com/software/poslib/
This text is now outdated, because new functions have been added and some of
the semantics have changed. For updated documentation, read the code :-) and
a POSIX manual. I used this online reference for POSIX:
	http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/toc.htm
To see a summary of what is exported to Lua, do "make xx". The examples in
test.lua and tree.lua show the library in action.

This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
